`ote` updates a packages' `go.mod` file with a comment next to all dependencies that are test dependencies; identifying them as such.   

It's name is derived from Kenyan hip hop artiste, `Oteraw`(One third of the hiphop group `Kalamashaka`).                               

By default, `go` and its related tools(`go mod` etc) do not differentiate regular dependencies from test ones when updating/writing the `go.mod` file.    
There are various reasons why this is so, see [go/issues/26955](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26955) [go/issues/26913](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26913)      
Thus `ote` fills that missing gap.   
It is not perfect, but it seems to work when it works. See [How it works](#how-it-works)
